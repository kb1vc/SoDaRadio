SVN 116 (branch TuneStep)  Changed the RX tuning in this rev so that
the integer-N mode picks the nearest integer-N frequency that is 1MHz
below the target. (See USRPCtrl::getNearestStep() )  This is done 
from a map built at startup time. (See USRPCtrl::initStepMap ). 

Also re-arranged RX freq setting code for the B2xx series.  This may 
eliminate the spectrum display problems as the tuning is swept....
