/**
 * @file IFServer.hxx
 *
 * IFServer is an example of a simple "plugin" that may be 
 * built as a shareable library and then loaded into SoDaRadio
 * via the loadable plugin interface. 
 * 
 * Plugins may be loaded by setting an environment variable
 * "SODA_LOAD_LIBS" or by providing the "--load" option to 
 * the SoDaServer.  
 * 
 * For instance, once this plugin has been built, it will be loaded 
 * by this command: 
 * 
~~~
$ SoDaRadio --serverargs "--load libIFServer.so"
~~~
 * 
 * or, using an environment variable instead: 
 * 
~~~
$ export SODA_LOAD_LIBS=libIFServer.so
$ SoDaRadio
~~~
 *
 * User developed plugins may find this a useful starting point.
