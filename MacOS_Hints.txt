port install gnuradio
port install libuhd-devel
port install libsnd

install qt from the qt.io mac installer. to /opt/local/qt

install qwt from source to /opt/local -- change QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX to
point to /opt/local/qwt


note that /opt is placed on /System/Volumes/Data which will fill up in short order.  Best to link it to some other volume.  Thanks Apple.


qwt is a trainwreck, but qt might be too.

After installing qwt you'll need to put the bits somewhere where cmake will
find them.  This is the only way I found to do it:

cd /opt/local/include
ln -s /opt/local/qwt/lib/qwt.framework/Versions/6/Headers qwt
cd /opt/local/lib
ln -s /opt/local/qwt/lib/qwt.framework/qwt libqwt.dylib
