port install gnuradio
port install libuhd-devel
port install libsnd

install qt from the qt.io mac installer. to /opt/local/qt

install qwt from source to /opt/local -- change QWT_INSTALL_PREFIX to
point to /opt/local/qwt-$$QWT_VERSION

note that /opt is placed on /System/Volumes/Data which will fill up in short order.  Best to link it to some other volume.  Thanks Apple.
