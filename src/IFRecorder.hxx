  /**
   * IFRecorder -- this is the audio processing chain for the recieve path
   *
   * @image html SoDa_Radio_RX_Signal_Path.svg
   *
   * The IFRecorder unit accepts the 3rd IF (nominally 80kHz to 200kHz)
   * from the USRPRX thread on the rx_stream.
   *
   * In most cases (all but Wide Band FM) the rx stream is downselected
   * by a 625 to 48 resampler before being passed through an audio filter
   * and finally demodulated.
   *
   * As each buffer/timeslice is demodulated, it
   * is placed on a queue of outbound audio blocks for the host processor's
   * audio system. Since there is some slop in the timing (specifically, the
   * clock governing the radio is not necessarily in sync with the audio
   * system clock) the IFRecorder unit monitors the backlog of outbound audio
   * buffers.  When this backlog gets longer than about 400mS, the unit will
   * "drop out" a sample here and there until the downstream sound system
   * catches up.
   *
   * IFRecorder supports CW_U (upper sideband CW), CW_L (lower sideband CW),
   * USB, and LSB modulation via the phasing method, since both I and Q
   * channels are available. AM is performed with a simple magnitude detector.
